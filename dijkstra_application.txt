OPEN SHORTEST PATH  FIRST (OSPF)   
The most widely used routing protocols is OSPF and is suitable for  large  network.  OSPF  is  a  Link  State  protocol  based  on  cost under a single routing solution that maintains information of all nodes  on  the  network.  Since  each  nodes  holds  the  entire  ne
twork  structure  information,  each  nodes  can  independently  calculate  the  path  to  reach  the  destination  by  adopting  shortest  path algorithm namely Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm.
